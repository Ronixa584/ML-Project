# ML-Project
A ML models to predict a crop based on attributes
like temperature , humidity , ph , rainfall ,etc using
different ML algorithms.


# Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Objective: 
To predict the most suitable crop for a given set of environmental attributes, including temperature, humidity, pH level, rainfall, and more.

## Methodology: 
Employed various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Data: 
Utilized a dataset containing historical agricultural data with attributes such as climate conditions and soil properties.

## Algorithm Performance:

Random Forest yielded the highest accuracy among the algorithms tested, indicating its effectiveness in crop prediction.
## Benefits:

Accurate crop prediction can help farmers make informed decisions about planting, leading to better yields and resource utilization.
## Future Work:

Potential for further improvement by fine-tuning model parameters and incorporating real-time weather data for more accurate predictions.
In conclusion, this project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict crops based on environmental attributes, with Random Forest performing as the most accurate algorithm. The application of this model can provide valuable insights for farmers and contribute to efficient crop management.
